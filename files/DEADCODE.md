# DEADCODE

This directory is DEADCODE and appears to be adjudicator test files for some demo,

They are not currently referenced by any other items in the repo
tho sim1 appears to have some HTML file pair in /exportToHTML

 perhaps we can find them a home elsewhere.
or at least move them into a better folder with the rest of the tests
