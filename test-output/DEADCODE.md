# DEADCODE

This entire directory is in essence DEADCODE.

I ran it with python -m http.server and pulled it up in a web browser
It is just code to provide some data-visualization for Junit Test suites 
which have not been updated in 6 years. There is no where in the source
anymore that calls JUnitXMLReporter that was used to generate these tests.

It should probably be either discarded or moved to its own project for archival purposes.
